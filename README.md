## About The Project:

### Product Display:
- The main concept for displaying products is that there is a 'products grid' that stores multiple 'product containers'. 
- The product details are saved in the form of objects in an array in a js file.
- The array is then used by JavaScript to loop through and generate HTML for each container and using DOM display it on the screen.
- This method helps the user by eliminating the need to write HTML code for each container repetitively and makes the code more readable.
